# Trusted_CrowdFunding
The Trusted_CrowdFunding is one of my projects where we create a solidity file in the Etherium Remix IDE.
The notion is to build a smart contract that we can use in a crowd funding scenario.
The code attached with the repository is well documented and first introduces the reader with basics of the entire mechanism.
One can use the code on remix IDE and try hands-on on the smart contract.
